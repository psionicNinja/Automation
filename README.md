# Automation
Java coded automation with Selenium (Works in Chrome Only)


I've built some automation that will do the following:

1.) Launch the tickets site on the sign in page.

2.) After sign in, perform a search for the word, "show".

3.) Scroll to the bottom of the page and select an element from the suggested shows.

4.) Verify that the header text is on the page.

5.) Store results in a text file called testResults.txt.


NOTE: I included the chromedriver.exe in the project for convienience. If you don't trust it, just replace it with any from a Google search.
